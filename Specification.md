#Specification

Running the project starts a web-based service that allows users to interact with a daily planner web-application. While running, the web-application will run a daily planner with a graphic user interface. On the interface, users can add, delete, search, or modify their daily plans by clicking on the buttons â€“  selecting the cascader and using the checkbox, and input data with a basic widget to interact with the system.
The web-application is to support multi-users and mysql database search as well as the message queues.

* Login: This feature will prompt a widget which allows users to enter their username and password. The user identity is then authenticated.

* New Reminder: Add a new plan to the to do list of the current user. This will prompt a widget that allows users to input the event, place, flagged or not, and due date, the time remaining is then being calculated and will appear on this event.

* Check Box: This feature allows users to mark any completed events. The event is then marked as past and the time before due will not be calculated.

* Delete: This button allows users to delete an event. The event will be marked as deleted and will appear in the trash bin. The time remaining is still being calculated and the users are still able to check this event in the trash bin.

* Edit: This button will enable the users to edit any events they wish to modify. A widget is prompted with contents recorded in the database. The users are able to modify the event, place, and due date. Then, it will be updated in the database.
