#Project Accessibility Report

####Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle

* Principle 1: Equitable Use

We provide the same platform of use of all users.

Provisions for privacy, security, and safety are equally available to all users.

* Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

Our program facilitates the user's accuracy and precision. We could implement other choices of using features, for 
example, adding a shortcut key for functions.

* Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

Our program is simple but enough for basic daily planning. For each button or textbox, we include a straight-forward

* Principle 4: Perceptible Information

The interface of the program provides different visuals to show the calendar and number of completed tasks.

* Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

The program minimizes and guides the user to properly use the program. For example, when we schedule an event, we have 
a calendar for the user to click on a date instead of inserting a date by typing. This would avoid invalid date inputs.

* Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

The interface of our program is efficient to use. Users can create their tasks simply by selecting dates and entering 
names of their tasks. Registration and login work in a similar way. Any functionality of this program can be achieved 
by typing or moving a mouse, with only the movement of the arm and hand.

* Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

Program interface and interactive buttons provide sufficient size for a mouse to click on it with precision. Standing 
and sitting postures of the user can still use the program comfortably.

#### Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards

Since our program is a time management tool. We would target stakeholders who wish to manage their time better. 
Especially people who have many short term and long term events or goals. Using our application, they would improve 
work efficiency and time management with proper utility of the application. The application provides a simple visual 
pie chart and other representations that motivates the user to complete the tasks they have completed.

#### Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. 

We expect to add in additional features (in the future) that allow the user to distribute their event on a date to 
another user in interest. This would greatly open up the utilization of the program because businesses or schools or 
small groups of friends can share important dates on each other's calendar.
